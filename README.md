# Win10/11 x64-Kernal

Windows Kernal Programming by Patel Yosifovich? Trust me, you would rather code yourself. Reading that book is just a waste of time. That hyprocrite will tell you nothing.

The Driver Injector is a tool that allows you to inject your dlls into 90 percent of the processes on your computer(still figuring out how to by pass BE and EAC)by hijacking the main thread in Kernal mode.

HandleTableTrick.sln can make you disappear when you are reading other's memory. It deletes your process object from the Handle Table.

The APCRing0.sln inserts Users APCs to the target threads through kernal routine.
